## Kudos

I have developed `OOPerlDoc` in the scope of my job. Even though it was primary made for internal documentation purposes, `OOPerlDoc` was designed for a broad Perl developer audience. Eventually Mr. Halling, CEO of [Dimedis GmbH](http://www.dimedis.de), gave me the permission to publish this work as open software. Thanks!
